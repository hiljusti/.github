Hi, I'm Justin "J.R." Hill. I used to go by "hiljusti" which was my "alias"
at Amazon. I reserved the name on github as an organization to prevent any
redirect-squatting for any of my projects.

hiljusti@amazon.com was my email address when I worked at Amazon/AWS, and
"hiljusti" was my username in their internal systems.
